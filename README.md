### 📝 Want to Help? Easy Data Collection!

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Only submit data collected with Questie v1.0.63 or newer!**
- Older versions had collection bugs that produce incorrect data
- Your export will show the version - if it's older than v1.0.63, please update first

**Quick Start:**
1. **Update to latest version** (v1.0.63+)
2. Type `/qdc enable` to turn on collection - this should persist through log in/out
3. Quest normally - Questie automatically detects if a quest is not in the database and begins collecting data for it!
4. **NEW**: Left-click Questie minimap icon → "Export Quest Data" for quick access!
5. Share on [GitHub](https://github.com/trav346/Questie-Epoch/issues/new)

**Not feeling up to it?** No problem! Just use Questie normally. `/qdc disable`

## 💡 Known Issues

- Some Epoch quests still have placeholder data - please use /qdc enable to help collect data
- Map icons may not appear for quests with incomplete NPC/object data
- Project Epoch has modified numerous vanilla quests to be cross-faction, causing conflicts with the original database
- Modified vanilla quests may trigger "missing quest" alerts even though they exist (due to significant changes from original)
