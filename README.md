## 🐛 Known Issues & Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
- **Quest Markers Missing**: Some Project Epoch quests have incomplete data - enable data collection to help fix this
- **Quests show up that don't exist** Project Epoch has modified lots of vanilla quests that exists in Questie's Vanilla database. This is on ongoing process of cleanup. Please bear with me through updates.
