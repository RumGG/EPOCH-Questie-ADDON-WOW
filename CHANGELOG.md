  - The new split settings (enableAvailableWorldMap/enableAvailableMinimap) weren't being checked in ShouldBeHidden()
  - World map and minimap toggles now properly control available quest visibility independently
  - Legacy enableAvailable setting also properly respected for backward compatibility

  - Critical for validating profession requirements for these special quests

- **Complete Quest Icons Hidden Behind Available Quest Icons** - Fixed rendering priority for quest turn-in markers
  - Complete quest icons now render at highest priority (frame level 9, draw layer 7)
  - Available quest icons render at lower priority (frame level 7, draw layer 3)
  - Complete quest icons are 20% larger than available quests for better visibility
  - Added Priority field to icon data (100 for complete, 50 for available)
  - When an NPC has both complete and available quests, the turn-in icon always shows on top
  - Ensures players see their most important action (quest turn-in) first

- **GitHub Issue Templates Not Working** - Fixed templates not appearing when creating new issues (PR #1110)
  - Renamed `.github/issue_Template` folder to `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` (all uppercase)  
  - GitHub requires exact uppercase naming for issue templates to be recognized
  - Templates now properly appear when users create new issues

  - Data collector now properly saves and restores NPC tooltip settings when disabled
  - Data collector now initializes immediately when enabled in options
  - Tooltip ID options are now grayed out when data collection is enabled (prevents confusion since data collection forces all IDs on)
  - Added missing QuestieDataCollector module import in options panel

- **Runtime Stub Quest Colors Not Respecting User Settings** - Fixed [Epoch] quests always showing white/gray objectives regardless of color preference
  - Objectives without progress counts (exploration, events) were bypassing user's "Red to Green" color setting
  - Safety checks added for Epoch runtime stubs were incorrectly returning gray instead of respecting tracker color preferences
  - Now properly shows red for incomplete objectives and green for completed when "Red to Green" is selected
  - Fixes GitHub Issue #1135 where users reported white objectives despite having gradient colors enabled

- **CRITICAL: Available Quest Toggle Broken** - Fixed issue where disabling Available Quests caused icons to cluster at service NPCs
  - Quest icons were being drawn but redirected to flight masters, mailboxes, and spirit healers when toggle was off
  - Added proper check in `DrawAvailableQuest` to prevent drawing when `enableAvailable` is false
  - Icons now properly hide when Available Quests is disabled instead of clustering at wrong locations
  - Affected all zones, not just specific areas
  - This fixes the confusing behavior where quest data appeared on unrelated map pins

- **CRITICAL: Minimap Menu Toggles Breaking All Icons** - Fixed Available Quest and Objective toggles disabling ALL map icons
  - Available Quest toggle was incorrectly calling `ToggleNotes()` with its own state, affecting all icons globally
  - Objective toggle had the same bug, turning off all icons when disabled
  - Removed incorrect `ToggleNotes()` calls from both toggles
  - This fixes the issue where toggling these options would completely break icon display
  - Also fixes interaction with Trivial Quest toggle that was causing all icons to disappear

- **CRITICAL: Classic Database Using Wrong NPC Flag Values** - Fixed entire Classic database using Classic WoW 1.x flags instead of WotLK 3.3.5 flags
  - Classic and WotLK use completely different flag values for service NPCs (e.g., STABLEMASTER: Classic=8192 vs WotLK=4194304)
  - Fixed ~480 service NPCs with wrong flag values:
    - 43 Stable Masters (8193 -> 4194305) - were showing as flight masters
    - 14 Spirit Healers (0 -> 16385) - were completely missing
    - 61 Flight Masters (11 -> 8195) - including Gryphon Masters, Wind Rider Masters, Bat Handlers
    - 45 Innkeepers (133/135 -> 65669/65671)
    - 27 Bankers (256-259 -> 131072-131075)
    - 28 Auctioneers (4096 -> 2097152) - were completely missing from lists
    - 24 Battlemasters (2049 -> 1048577) - were not showing properly
    - 258 Repair NPCs (16388/16391 -> 4224/4227) - had wrong categorization
    - 22+ Vendors (6/7 -> 130/131)
  - This fixes stable masters showing as flight masters, spirit healers as vendors, and service NPCs missing entirely
  - Required complete database recompilation after flag fixes
  - Service NPC counts after fixes: 240 Repair, 40 Innkeepers, 35 Spirit Healers, 58 Flight Masters, 41 Stable Masters, 28 Auctioneers, 15 Battlemasters, 27 Bankers

- **Available Quests Disabled by Default** - Fixed Available Quests being OFF by default after fresh install
  - Available quests on map is a core Questie feature and should be enabled by default
  - Changed `enableAvailable` from false to true in QuestieOptionsDefaults
  - New users will now see available quests immediately after installation
